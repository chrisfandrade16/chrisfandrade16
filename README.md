# Hi! I'm Chris Andrade.

Hello there, I'm Chris Andrade. I'm a software engineer whose goal is to use the engineering skills I'm developing towards strong teams and big projects. I have more experience in full-stack application (backend/frontend) development, and some experience in software-hardware interfaces. I've gained many applicable skills through my undergrad, projects, hackathons, internships, volunteering experiences, and now my career. I love to work on projects that are focused on creating a satisfying experience, for both users and developers, with future-oriented design :).
