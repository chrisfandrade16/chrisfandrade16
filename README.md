# Hi! I'm Chris Andrade.

Hello there, I'm Chris Andrade. I'm a software engineer whose goal is to use the engineering skills I'm developing towards my passion of astronomy! I have much experience in full-stack (backend/frontend) development, and some experience in embedded software. I've gained many applicable skills through my bachelor's degree, my projects, hackathons, internships, volunteering experiences, and now my career. I love to work on teams that are collaborative and committed to the goal of scientific discovery :).
