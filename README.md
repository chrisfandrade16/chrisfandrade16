# Hi! I'm Chris Andrade.

Hello! I'm Chris Andrade. My job as a software engineer is to use the engineering skills I've developed (and developing!) towards data-heavy projects and well-organized teams. I have much experience in full-stack application development (backend/frontend), and in developmental operations automation. I've gained many applicable skills through my undergraduate degree, personal projects, hackathons, internships, volunteering experiences, and contracts. I love to work on teams and projects that are focused on future-oriented design, and creating an organized efficient developmental cycle.
