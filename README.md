# Hi! I'm Chris Andrade.

Hello, my name is Chris Andrade. I am currently a final year student at McMaster University studying Software Engineering. Most of my experience and skills are in full-stack development for mobile, web, and desktop applications, gained through my undergrad, personal projects, hackathons, internships, and volunteering positions. My goal is to use the skills I've learned (and continue to learn) in cohesive teams working on meaningful projects :).
